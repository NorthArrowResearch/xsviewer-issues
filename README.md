# CROSS SECTION VIEWER

The Cross Section Viewer is an interactive, graphical software for managing and visualizing river transect data. The software uses a simple data model that allows most types of transect data to be stored in the underlying database and viewed in the software. Tools include profile and longitudinal plots as well as several geomophic calculations that would typically take a user a considerable amount of time to produce.

This repo contains no code but is designed solely for reporting issues.
